# Dandiset-specific notes

The data starts at time 0 and ends around time 6000 seconds. But the odor presentations don't start until around 600 seconds. So if you're going to take a subsample of time to show the odor presentations, it's not going to work to look at the first several minutes.

If you are going to show the odor presentations, show all of them.

If you are going to load unit spike trains, select a small number of units (like 4) because it takes a while to load that data.
